### Importance of a User-Friendly Design in a Booking System  
A user-friendly design is crucial in a booking system to reduce friction and ensure users can complete their intended tasks with minimal effort. Features like intuitive navigation, clear visual cues, and efficient workflows enhance trust and satisfaction. This is particularly important for booking platforms, where a confusing or cumbersome interface can lead to user drop-off and missed business opportunities. By focusing on usability, the platform not only improves conversion rates but also fosters long-term user loyalty.
