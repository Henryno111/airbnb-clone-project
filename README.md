### Importance of a User-Friendly Design in a Booking System  
A user-friendly design is crucial in a booking system to reduce friction and ensure users can complete their intended tasks with minimal effort. Features like intuitive navigation, clear visual cues, and efficient workflows enhance trust and satisfaction. This is particularly important for booking platforms, where a confusing or cumbersome interface can lead to user drop-off and missed business opportunities. By focusing on usability, the platform not only improves conversion rates but also fosters long-term user loyalty.

### Importance of Identifying Design Properties of a Mock-Up Design  

Identifying design properties in a mock-up is a crucial step in the development process, as it bridges the gap between design concepts and functional implementation. A mock-up provides a visual guide and ensures that both designers and developers are aligned on the goals and expectations for the user interface.  

**Key Benefits of Identifying Design Properties:**  
1. **Clarity in Vision:** Clearly defined design properties (colors, typography, spacing, etc.) establish a consistent visual language across the application.  
2. **Improved Communication:** Mock-ups act as a reference point for discussions between stakeholders, designers, and developers, ensuring everyone is on the same page.  
3. **Efficient Development:** Developers can refer to the mock-up to extract details such as dimensions, font sizes, and component layouts, which speeds up the coding process.  
4. **Reduced Errors:** By understanding design properties early, discrepancies between the design and final product can be minimized, ensuring the UI looks and functions as intended.  
5. **Focus on User Experience:** Mock-ups help prioritize essential features and identify potential usability issues before development begins, saving time and resources.  

By thoroughly analyzing and identifying design properties, the team can create a polished and user-friendly application that meets the initial design vision and enhances the overall user experience.
